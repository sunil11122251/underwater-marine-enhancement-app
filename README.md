# 🌊 Adaptive Image Enhancement Techniques for Underwater Marine Visuals
> **A Hybrid Parallel Enhancement Framework using Classical Processing and ADGOL Deep Refinement**

This project presents a deployable web-based system for restoring degraded underwater images affected by color cast, scattering, low contrast, and poor visibility. The approach follows a **parallel enhancement architecture** where LAB-based contrast enhancement and visibility restoration operate simultaneously and are later fused, followed by deep learning refinement using the ADGOL network.

---

##  Project Overview

Underwater Marine images typically suffer from:

- Wavelength-dependent absorption of red light  
- Scattering from suspended particles  
- Blue/green color dominance  
- Loss of contrast and structural details  

The proposed system addresses these issues through a **hybrid adaptive framework** combining classical image processing with a lightweight CNN.

---

##  Objectives

- Restore natural underwater color balance  
- Improve visibility and contrast without artifacts  
- Preserve structural and edge information  
- Provide stage-wise analysis and metrics  
- Deliver a user-friendly enhancement tool

##  Technical Methodology

### 1. Pre-Processing
- **White Balance Correction**  
  Removes dominant color cast and normalizes RGB channels.

### 2. Parallel Enhancement Branches

#### Branch A – LAB Correction
- CLAHE on luminance channel  
- Local contrast improvement  
- Structural detail preservation

#### Branch B – Visibility Restoration
- Adaptive gamma adjustment  
- Illumination normalization  
- Dehazing effect

### 3. Fusion Strategy
- Weighted fusion of both branches  
- Complementary feature integration  
- Balanced color and detail

### 4. Deep Refinement – ADGOL
- Lightweight CNN model  
- Residual artifact removal  
- Edge & texture enhancement
